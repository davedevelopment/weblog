The previous post introduced a basic implementation of evaluation that is
lacking on many fronts. It currently only supports s-expressions which are
function applications. The objective is to add support for different types of
sexprs.

In Lisp lingo, a *form* is an object that can be evaluated. Based on the current
state of the AST, there are four different types of forms that it can model:

* **List:** The list form represents a function application. Its elements are
  also forms. Evaluating the list will evaluate nested lists recursively by
  applying the `car` to the `cdr`. Or in other words, applying the function to
  its arguments.

* **Symbol:** A symbol is an identifier that usually references a value in
  the environment. It is a variable name if you will. Evaluating a symbol looks
  up the name in the environment and returns the associated value.

* **Literal:** A literal represents a value. Numbers are literals. Evaluating
  a literal just returns its value.

* **Quote:** A quote form represents a value or a list of values in quoted
  form. Evaluating a quote form returns the value that is being quoted.

Currently only list forms are supported, and they are only supported
partially.

## Form interface

Before looking into adding support for the other forms I want to introduce
forms into the code base as a concept. A form is an object that can be
evaluated. It is evaluated against an environment. A form represents the
behaviour or functionality of an AST node.

This abstraction can be encoded into a `Form` interface that all forms must
implement:

~~~php
namespace Igorw\Ilias\Form;

use Igorw\Ilias\Environment;

interface Form
{
    public function evaluate(Environment $env);
}
~~~

With this interface it is easy to create separate form classes for the
different types of forms. To match the functionality of the previous post's
`evaluate` function, there must be a `ListForm`:

~~~php
namespace Igorw\Ilias\Form;

use Igorw\Ilias\Environment;

class ListForm implements Form
{
    private $forms;

    public function __construct(array $forms)
    {
        $this->forms = $forms;
    }

    public function evaluate(Environment $env)
    {
        $fn = $this->car();
        $args = $this->cdr();

        return call_user_func_array($env[$fn], $args);
    }

    public function car()
    {
        return $this->forms[0];
    }

    public function cdr()
    {
        return new static(array_slice($this->forms, 1));
    }
}
~~~

This is exactly the same as the `evaluate`, `car` and `cdr` functions, but
they are now encapsulated within an object.

> Note: The `Environment` implements the `ArrayAccess` interface. Its
> implementation will be discussed later on.

## Form tree

Now that there is a good abstraction it's time to fix how list forms are
evaluated. The major limitations are:

* The `car` cannot be an expression, it is currently assumed to be a symbol.
* The `cdr` cannot contain expressions, it is assumed to be a list of
  literals.

To fix the first issue we must not assume the `car` to be a symbol. Instead,
it should be assumed to be any form that can be evaluated. If it is a
`SymbolForm`, that form will perform the environment lookup itself and return
the value.

The implementation of `SymbolForm` is trivial:

~~~php
namespace Igorw\Ilias\Form;

use Igorw\Ilias\Environment;

class SymbolForm implements Form
{
    private $symbol;

    public function __construct($symbol)
    {
        $this->symbol = $symbol;
    }

    public function evaluate(Environment $env)
    {
        return $env[$this->symbol];
    }
}
~~~

That solves the the `car` problem, since it can now be any form. It gets
evaluated when the `ListForm` is evaluated.

The next problem is that the `cdr` is assumed to be a list of literals. The
same pattern that was applied for `car` can be applied here as well.

Instead of using the `cdr` values directly, they should be assumed to be a
list of forms, each of which is evaluated before the function is applied.

This means that literals need to be represented as forms as well:

~~~php
namespace Igorw\Ilias\Form;

use Igorw\Ilias\Environment;

class LiteralForm implements Form
{
    private $value;

    public function __construct($value)
    {
        $this->value = $value;
    }

    public function evaluate(Environment $env)
    {
        return $this->value;
    }
}
~~~

Going back to the `ListForm`, here is the adjusted version which calls
`evaluate` on `car` and each element of `cdr` before applying the function:

~~~php
use Igorw\Ilias\Environment;

class ListForm implements Form
{
    ...

    public function evaluate(Environment $env)
    {
        $func = $this->car()->evaluate($env);
        $args = $this->evaluateArgs($env, $this->cdr());

        return call_user_func_array($func, $args);
    }

    ...

    public function toArray()
    {
        return $this->forms;
    }

    private function evaluateArgs(Environment $env, ListForm $args)
    {
        return array_map(
            function ($arg) use ($env) {
                return $arg->evaluate($env);
            },
            $args->toArray()
        );
    }
}
~~~

This form tree should eliminate the problems of the previous `evaluate`
implementation. The only step left is constructing the forms.

If you want to see the implementation of `QuoteForm`, it can be found in the
Ilias repo:
[`Igorw\Ilias\Form\QuoteForm`](https://github.com/igorw/ilias/blob/master/src/Igorw/Ilias/Form/QuoteForm.php).

## Form tree builder

To create a form tree, there must be some object that is able to parse the
AST and translate the AST nodes into forms. For lack of a better name, this
object shall be called `FormTreeBuilder`.

For a sample input of:

~~~php
[['+', 1, 2]]
~~~

The tree builder should return:

~~~php
[
    new Form\ListForm([
        new Form\SymbolForm('+'),
        new Form\LiteralForm(1),
        new Form\LiteralForm(2),
    ])
]
~~~

Implementing such a builder is quite trivial. The interface will be a method
named `parseAst`:

~~~php
namespace Igorw\Ilias;

class FormTreeBuilder
{
    public function parseAst(array $ast);
}
~~~

The AST is an array of s-expressions, `parseAst` will parse each one of them
and return an array of forms:

~~~php
public function parseAst(array $ast)
{
    return array_map([$this, 'parseSexpr'], $ast);
}
~~~

An s-expression is either a list of s-expressions or an atom. Atoms are
handled by `parseAtom`. Lists are recursively parsed into a `ListForm`. Each
element of a list is a fully parsed form.

~~~php
public function parseSexpr($sexpr)
{
    if (!is_array($sexpr)) {
        return $this->parseAtom($sexpr);
    }

    $list = $this->parseAst($sexpr);
    return new Form\ListForm($list);
}
~~~

An atom is either a quoted value, a symbol or a literal. A quoted values
becomes `QuoteForm`, a symbol becomes a `SymbolForm` and a literal becomes a
`LiteralForm`.

~~~php
private function parseAtom($atom)
{
    if ($atom instanceof Ast\QuotedValue) {
        return new Form\QuoteForm($atom);
    }

    if (is_string($atom)) {
        return new Form\SymbolForm($atom);
    }

    return new Form\LiteralForm($atom);
}
~~~

That is already enough to construct the form tree correctly. It's just a dumb
mapping from AST nodes to form objects.

## Environment

One part that I did not explain yet is the environment. Previously this was
just a simple array of values. Now it is an `Environment` object that
implements the `ArrayAccess` interface.

In fact this `Environment` is really just a class that extends `ArrayObject`,
without adding any new behaviour. It allows for type hints and also enables
adding convenience factory methods that create pre-set environments. The
previous `environment` function can be replaced with a `standard` factory
method that returns an Environment which has all the core methods on it.

~~~php
namespace Igorw\Ilias;

class Environment extends \ArrayObject
{
    public static function standard()
    {
        return new static([
            '+' => new Func\PlusFunc(),
        ]);
    }
}
~~~

Finally, the `plus` function should be moved to a `PlusFunc` class so that it
can be autoloaded. If PHP supported function autoloading this would not be
necessary. Using the `__invoke` magic method, the "function object" can
pretend to be a function.

~~~php
namespace Igorw\Ilias\Func;

class PlusFunc
{
    public function __invoke()
    {
        return array_sum(func_get_args());
    }
}
~~~

As you can see, the implementation is identical to `plus`. It behaves the same
way.

## Usage

Phew.

This new evaluation process should be able to evaluate literals, nested
applications and symbols. Here is how the pieces are put together:

~~~php
$ast = [['+', 1, 2]];
$env = Environment::standard();

$builder = new FormTreeBuilder();
$forms = $builder->parseAst($ast);

foreach ($forms as $form) {
    var_dump($form->evaluate($env));
}
~~~

This correctly returns `3`.

Let's try some more complex examples with nested `car` and `cdr`:

~~~php
$ast = [
    ['+', 1, ['+', 2, 3]],
    [['get-plus-func'], 1, 2],
    ['get-random-number'],
];

$env = Environment::standard();
$env['get-plus-func'] = function () use ($env) {
    return $env['+'];
};
$env['get-random-number'] = function () {
    return 4;
};
~~~

And sure enough, these correctly evaluate to `6`, `3` and `4` respectively.
Ã‡a marche!

## Summary

* Introduced a new concept of forms, which are objects that can be evaluated.
* There are different types of forms: List, Symbol, Literal, Quote.
* The `FormTreeBuilder` parses an AST into a nested tree of forms.

The next post will introduce a completely new concept: Special forms. They
will allow adding more low-level building blocks to the language, such as
`if`, `define` and user-land functions.

## μKanren: A Minimal Functional Core for Relational Programming

*Jason Hemann, Daniel P. Friedman*

The authors present an extremely tiny implementation of miniKanren in just
under 40 lines of scheme. The conciseness and especially the lack of macros
make this an excellent starting point for building a miniKanren system in a
non-lisp.

Basically, Dan Friedman spent the last 10 or so years building logic
programming systems in scheme. Together with Jason Hemann, the essence of
those systems was extracted, and that distilled product is μKanren. It gets to
the core of what it means to build a relational machine, and does so on a
level that is actually usable in practice.

## μKanren: A Minimal Functional Core for Relational Programming

*Jason Hemann, Daniel P. Friedman*

The authors present an extremely tiny implementation of miniKanren in just
under 40 lines of scheme. The conciseness and especially the lack of macros
make this an excellent starting point for building a miniKanren system in a
non-lisp.

Basically, Dan Friedman spent the last 10 or so years building logic
programming systems in scheme. The distilled product is μKanren. These are the
magical few lines of code one must type in order to build a relational
machine.

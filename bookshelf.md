## The Little Schemer

*By Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen*

This book is an introduction into the world of Lisp. It teaches you to think
in terms of recursion.

Just some of the things it contains:

* Building on top of primitives
* Functions: the essence of abstraction
* Approaching computation from a functional perspective
* Termination
* Applicative-order Y combinator
* Meta-circular evaluator

## Understanding Computation

*By Tom Stuart*

Fundamental understanding of what computation is at its core. Computer science
topics explained in a very approachable way, through implementing various
simple machines in very few lines of ruby code.

Just a rough sampling of what it covers:

* Semantics
* Finite state machine
* Pushdown automata
* Turing machine
* Lambda calculus
* Universality
* Halting problem

introduction to propositional logic. Punny dialogues.

* Strange loops
* Formal systems
* Recursion
* Intelligence
* Levels of abstraction
* Meaning
* Propositional logic
* The brain

## The Annotated Turing

*By Charles Petzold and Alan Turing*

A very heavy but authentic description of turing machines and the
unsolvability to the Entscheidungsproblem. Requires some understanding of
turing machines and propositional logic to grasp. Lots of little historical
notes.

* Number theory
* Turing's machine
* Universal machine
* Propositional logic
* Entscheidungsproblem
* Equivalence to lambda calculus
* Intuitionistic logic

## Unlocking the Clubhouse

*By Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher*

> Boys invent things and girls use things boys invent.

We have a diversity problem. It's a cultural problem. This book sheds some
light on why women and other minorities are "out of the loop" of computing,
and how we might fix the leaky pipeline.

This case study at CMU showed that by changing culture and mindset, computer
science education *can* be made more accessible, so that future generations of
makers will be diverse enough to survive.

We should probably also fix the toxic culture in our industry to actually keep
these diverse people.

## Logicomix

*By Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou*

A graphic novel telling the tale of Bertrand Russel's journey through early
20th century mathematical logic.

It is indeed an epic search for truth.

## Unspeakable Things

*By Laurie Penny*

> I will make you a sandwich. It will be stuffed with the dust of history, and
> I hope you choke on it.

The chapter on cybersexism is particularly relevant to all nerds. Just read it.

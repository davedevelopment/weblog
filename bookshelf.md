## The Little Schemer

*By Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen*

This book is an introduction into the world of Lisp. It teaches you to think
in terms of recursion.

Just some of the things it contains:

* Building on top of primitives
* Functions: the essence of abstraction
* Approaching computation from a functional perspective
* Termination
* Applicative-order Y combinator
* Meta-circular evaluator

## Understanding Computation

*By Tom Stuart*

Fundamental understanding of what computation is at its core. Computer science
topics explained in a very approachable way, through implementing various
simple machines in very few lines of ruby code.

Just a rough sampling of what it covers:

* Semantics
* Finite state machine
* Pushdown automata
* Turing machine
* Lambda calculus
* Universality
* Halting problem

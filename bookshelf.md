## The Little Schemer

*By Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen*

This book is an introduction into the world of Lisp. It teaches you to think
in terms of recursion.

Just some of the things it contains:

* Building on top of primitives
* Functions: the essence of abstraction
* Approaching computation from a functional perspective
* Termination
* Applicative-order Y combinator
* Meta-circular evaluator

## Understanding Computation

*By Tom Stuart*

Fundamental understanding of what computation is at its core. Computer science
topics explained in a very approachable way, through implementing various
simple machines in very few lines of ruby code.

Just a rough sampling of what it covers:

* Semantics
* Finite state machine
* Pushdown automata
* Turing machine
* Lambda calculus
* Universality
* Halting problem

Finishes with building an actual computer from scratch.

* Binary codes
* Basic electronics
* Logic gates
* Binary adder
* Flip-flops, Clocks

A beautiful journey through formal systems, levels of abstraction, recursion,
attempting to describe how consciousness can arise from lower levels. Decent
introduction to propositional logic. Punny dialogues.

* Strange loops
* Formal systems
* Recursion
* Intelligence
* Levels of abstraction
* Meaning
* Propositional logic
* The brain
* Consciousness
* Computation
* Genetics

## The Annotated Turing

*By Charles Petzold and Alan Turing*

A very heavy but authentic description of turing machines and the
unsolvability to the Entscheidungsproblem. Requires some understanding of
turing machines and propositional logic to grasp. Lots of little historical
notes.

* Number theory
* Turing's machine
* Universal machine
* Propositional logic
* Entscheidungsproblem
* Equivalence to lambda calculus
* Intuitionistic logic

## Unlocking the Clubhouse

*By Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher*

> Boys invent things and girls use things boys invent.

We have a diversity problem. It's a cultural problem. This book sheds some
light on why women and other minorities are "out of the loop" of computing,
and how we might fix the leaky pipeline.

While the presented research focuses mostly on the computer science department
at CMU, a lot of the culture in our industry is an amplified reflection of the
culture that is forged in schools and universities.
